const aboutUsData = `\t&:bShree Vindhyavasini Secondary School&:~b, nestled in the historic Batulechaur of Pokhara, Nepal, stands as a beacon of education in the community. Its roots can be traced back to the establishment of the 'Bhasha Pathashala' in 1971 B.S., a language school dedicated to teaching rituals, astrology, and mathematics. Inspired by this legacy, the Vindhyavasini Aadhar School was born in 2004, with the noble vision of imparting Gandhian education.\n\n\tOriginally envisioned near the revered Vindhya Vasini temple, fate led the school to find its home in Batulechaur, aptly adopting the name Vindhyavasini Adhar School. Under the guidance of its first founder headmaster, Pandit Muktinath Sharma Timsina, the school commenced its journey with 23 young minds in the first-grade class. Over time, it expanded to include lower secondary and secondary levels, becoming a stronghold of knowledge in 2014 B.S. and 2018 B.S. respectively.\n\n\tIn the milestone year of 2021 B.S., the inaugural batch of seven students faced the SLC examination, leaving no room for disappointment as they all emerged victorious. To commemorate its 50th glorious year, the school organized the Golden Jubilee celebration, a testament to its unwavering commitment to education. The festivities included the Shrimad Bhagavata Mahapuran and National Mahayagya, held from the 23rd to the 30th of Kartik, 2057 B.S., paving the way for the establishment of a 10 + 2 level.\n\n\tContinuing its pursuit of excellence, the school ventured into the Management stream for Grade 11 in 2058 B.S., followed by the Education and Humanities streams in subsequent years. In the illustrious school building, the Bachelor of Management (BBS) program has been flourishing since 2066 B.S. In a remarkable transition, the school embraced English as the medium of instruction from the same year, catering to students from kindergarten to grade twelve. Today, with over 1200 students and a dedicated team of 86 staff members, Shree Vindhyavasini Secondary School stands tall.\n\n\tRecognized for its academic prowess, the school achieved the second position in Kaski district and the third position in Gandaki Province, based on the SEE examination. Such commendable achievements did not go unnoticed, as the Ministry of Social Development, Gandaki Province, bestowed upon the school the prestigious award on the 40th National Education Day and World Literacy Day.\n\n\tLooking ahead, the school is poised to introduce Science and Management subjects as optional choices for grade 11 from 2077 B.S. The administration also envisions the inclusion of technical streams in the near future. With its motto, "Discipline and Dedication for Quality Education," Shree Vindhyavasini Secondary School aspires to lead as a premier government institution, shaping disciplined and dedicated individuals who will contribute to the prosperity of their nation.`;
